 To connect the ESP32 board using Arduino IDE:
1. Install the ESP32 board support in Arduino IDE:
    - Go to File > Preferences.
    - In the "Additional Board Manager URLs" field, add:
      `https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json`
    - Go to Tools > Board > Board Manager, search for "ESP32" and install it.
2. Select the ESP32 board:
    - Go to Tools > Board and select your specific ESP32 board model.
3. Connect the ESP32 to your computer via USB.
4. Select the correct port:
    - Go to Tools > Port and select the port corresponding to your ESP32.
5. Copy the provided code into a new sketch in Arduino IDE.
6. Upload the sketch to the ESP32:
    - Click the upload button (right arrow icon) in the Arduino IDE.
7. Open the Serial Monitor (Ctrl + Shift + M) to view the output and interact with the ESP32.
8. Ensure the baud rate in the Serial Monitor matches the one set in the code (115200).
9. You can now send commands to unlock or lock the door by typing 'UNLOCK' or 'LOCK' in the Serial Monitor.


Make sure to connect the TX and RX pins of the ESP32 to the corresponding pins on your Arduino or other microcontroller.
Ensure that the pins used for UART communication (tx and rx) are correctly connected to the ESP32.
